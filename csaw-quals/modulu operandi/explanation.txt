Modulu operandi was a crypto challenge accessible through netcat. It accepted input from the user, and returned a ciphertext back which was encrypted with either a ECB or CBC block cipher. It then required the user to correctly state whether ECB or CBC was used. After 176 correct guesses, no input or output is accepted and no flag is revealed. However, the flag can be discnered by recording whether ECB or CBC was sent. An ECB is a 0, a CBC is a 1. Decoding the binary reveals the flag.
My solution was a python script which used a block of code to determine whether a plaintext and generated ciphertext were ECB or CBC. The script then automates the send and receive, only outputting ECB and CBC to the terminal to be manually turned into 0's and 1's.
